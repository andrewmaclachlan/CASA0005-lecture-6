Two halves: 

* Rapid overview of point pattern analysis
* Detecting spatial patterns - where are they
* Point data (or categorical data in space - lines / polygons)

* Spatially referenced observations - where regions of a map are similar = clustering of values = spatial autocorrelation. 

* Methods to detect if these patterns are there or not - it might just be use seeing them

# Part 1: Point Pattern Analysis


---

# Questions we can ask / set

**Points**

Are these points distributed in a random way or is there some sort of pattern (uniform or clustered)?

**Spatially continuous observations (e.g. values of polygons)**

How (dis)similar are our values assigned to geographic units across geographic space

John snow often attributed with identifying the outbreak at the broad street pump
Data was from mortality reports issued by the Registrar General Office not surveys
Snow wasn't responsible directly, but it contributed to the knowledge 
Snow also didn't invent this mapping style - 1795 New York outbreak of Yellow fever - Valentine Seaman

# Background

.pull-left[

* In response to the Cholera outbreak in 1854 

* This was the third outbreak the city had seen....

* John Snow saw a pattern from those dying of the disease ...

* a **spatial pattern**

* He was a doctor and pioneered the use of anesthesia

# History of point pattern


.pull-left[

* John snow often attributed with identifying the outbreak at the broad street pump

* Data was from mortality reports **issued by the Registrar General Office not surveys**

* Snow wasn't responsible directly, but it contributed to the knowledge 

* Snow also didn't invent this mapping style

* Snow didn't make the map, drawing was done by **Charles Cheffins** and probably others

* Valentine Seamen (1770-1817) did **before Snow was even born!**

# The Poisson Distribution 3

### Rules / applies when 

* The events are discrete and can be counted in integers
* Events are independent of each other
* The average number of events over space (or time) is known

### Use

* It’s very useful in Point Pattern Analysis as it allows us to compare a random expected model to our observations

* Where our data **do not fit the Poisson model, then something interesting might be going on!**

* Our events might not be independent of each other – they might be clustered or dispersed and something might be causing this...

# Quadrat Analysis

* The (Poisson) probability (Pr) of an event (brewery in a quadrat square) is calculated ...
ex
`$$Pr= (X =k) = \frac{\lambda^{k}e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$$`
where:

* `\(x\)` is the number of occurrences 

* `\(λ\)` is the mean number of occurrences

* `\(e\)` is a constant- 2.718

* `\(k!\)` is the factorial of the number of occurences `\(((e.g. 4! = 1*2*3*4))\)`

* Here, remember `\(X=k\)` - they are the same here.

# From points to spatially continuous observations 3

* In this case we could sum our counts and normalise then based on some sort of underling data - such as population. e.g...lung cancer rates or mortality rates 

Our code would look similar to this ...


```r
points_sf_joined &lt;- LondonWardsMerged%&gt;%
  st_join(BluePlaquesSub)%&gt;%
  add_count(ward_name)%&gt;%
  janitor::clean_names()%&gt;%
  #calculate area
  mutate(area=st_area(.))%&gt;%
  #then density of the points per ward
  mutate(density=n/area)%&gt;%
  #select density and some other variables 
  dplyr::select(density, ward_name, gss_code, n, average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014)
```

* Sometimes we can have "unstable rates" - where values are very small, consult [Coping with Unstable Rates](Gimond, 2022)

# Standardisation of matrix

Standardisation **permits comparable** spatial parameters where features might be biased due to the aggregation... 

When you standardise (usually row) the fact that one unit has 20 neighbours and another 2 doesn't influence the results that much, but it would in binary. When we aggregate data the structure (e.g. polygons) aren't made for (or designed for) our point data (e.g. blue plaques, fly tipping etc). See [this ESRI help link](https://community.esri.com/t5/spatial-statistics-questions/row-standardisation-questions/td-p/440656)

Global
* Sum the weights = 18
* Divide our units by this = 6/18 
* Each weight is given 0.33

Row
* 1 is divided by the sum of the number of neighbours in each row
* In zone 1 each weight is 0.5 - Binary it would sum to 2 
* In zone 3 each weight is 0.25 - Binary it would sum to 4

* Once we have the z score we compare it to the confidence levels to see it was by complete spatial randomness 

* If it does we expect it to be in the middle of the distribution...Null hypothesis...

* If it is within the tails then it is not completely random ...reject the null hypthoesis

* The Moran's I value (or +ve /-ve Z score) will tell us if it is clustering (+ve) or dispersion (-ve)...

We interpret this as...

&gt; `&gt;2.58` or `&lt;-2.58` standard deviations away from the mean are significant at the 99% level...this means there is a &lt;1% chance that autocorrelation not present

&gt; `&gt;1.96 - &lt;2.58` or` &lt;-1.96 to &gt;-2.58` are significant at the 95% level (&lt;5% change that autocorrelation not present)

* **Core idea** is to identify areas that are more similar (or dissimilar) to surroundings based on what we expect by chance!

* In this case Prof Dani Arribas-Bel has standardised the values (subtract average and devided by standard deviation) for brexit votes

* This gives us those with above average leave voting and below average leave voting

# Local versions - Anselins Moran's I

### Remember what the values mean

### Moran's I tells us whether we have clustered values (close to 1) or dispersed values (close to -1) 

### **for local this is in relation to its neighbours**...

### for global it's all values as an average

---

# Local versions - Getis-Ord Gi* 

* Pronounced G-i-star

* Similar concept but **just returns a z score**
  * standardised value relating to whether high values or low values are clustering together
  * However....this takes the local sum which is then compared to the **sum of all features**
  * A high value = sum of values within a neighborhood of a given radius or configuration is high relative to the global average

* More intense clustering of high values = hot spot 

* More intense clustering of low values = cold spot

# Moran's I  vs Getis-Ord Gi* notes

.pull-left[

* Moran’s I is a measure of the degree to which the value at a target site is similar to values at adjacent sites. Moran’s I is large and positive when the value for a given target (or for all locations in the global case) is similar to adjacent values and negative when the value at a target is dissimilar to adjacent values.

]


.pull-right[

* Getis Ord G∗i identifies areas where high or low values cluster in space. It is high where the sum of values within a neighborhood of a given radius or configuration is high relative to the global average and negative where the sum of values within a neighborhood are small relative to the global average and approaches 0 at intermediate values.

# Limitations 

* Calculating the neighbours is computationally intensive. Creates an `\(n^2\)` matrix.

* So 10 spatial units is manageable, but 1000 requires 1,000,000 comparisons, and 10,000 100,000,000 etc. 

* This is very important as defining spatial weights matrices is crucial for running other types of analysis – spatially-lagged regression or Geographical Weighted Regression (which we will come onto in subsequent weeks)

* Global measures can mask local trends (although local versions deal with this to an extent)

* Indices of spatial association can be a good summary of the system, but it’s never possible to capture all complex spatial interactions in a single figure

* **DO NOT COMPARE IF THEY HAVE DIFFERENT ZONES**

# The next question...

## We know where the clusters are but why are they there....or can we explain what is happening...

# Summary

#### Points

* Are these points distributed in a random way or is there some sort of pattern (uniform or  clustered)?

* Point Pattern Analysis techniques all compare observed distributions of points to an expected model based on the Poisson distribution – with varying degrees of sophistication

#### Spatially continuous observations (e.g. values of polygons)

* How (dis)similar are our values assigned to geographic units across geographic space

* Analysis of the spatial autocorrelation of continuous variables over space allows us to assess if similar values cluster in space

* How we define neighbours is crucial in spatial autocorrelation analysis

# Final task

### Consider the tools for point pattern anslysis and spatial autocorrelcation and write down what each can show...e.g...

### Moran's I shows if neighbouring places have more similar (or dissimilar) values when compared with their difference to the average in the system

### Local Moran's I shows....?

# How to use the lectures

- Slides are made with [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1) `r emo::ji("speak")` shar-in-gen or [ʃæ.ˈriŋ.gæn]

- `r fa("search")` In the bottom left there is a search tool which will search all content of presentation

- Control + F will also search 

- Press enter to move to the next result 

- `r fa("pencil-alt")` In the top right let's you draw on the slides, although these aren't saved.

- Pressing the letter `o` (for overview) will allow you to see an overview of the whole presentation and go to a slide

- Alternatively just typing the slide number e.g. 10 on the website will take you to that slide

- Pressing alt+F will fit the slide to the screen, this is useful if you have resized the window and have another open - side by side.

Two halves: 

* Rapid overview of point pattern analysis
* Detecting spatial patterns - where are they
* Point data (or categorical data in space - lines / polygons)

* Spatially referenced observations - where regions of a map are similar = clustering of values = spatial autocorrelation.

John snow often attributed with identifying the outbreak at the broad street pump
Data was from mortality reports issued by the Registrar General Office not surveys
Snow wasn't responsible directly, but it contributed to the knowledge 
Snow also didn't event this mapping style - 1798 New York outbreak of Yellow fever - Valentine Seaman

# Quantifying Spatial Patterns

What is fixed?

.pull-left[

### Point Pattern Analysis

* Properties are fixed (e.g. binary - present or not)
* Discrete objects - present or not, binary, yes or no.
* Examples: fly tipping, stop and search, blue plaques, pharmacies 

Properties fixed, but **space (location - x,y)** can vary

]

.pull-right[

### Spatial Autocorrelation

* Space (e.g. the location of the spatial units - wards, boroughs etc) is fixed
* The values of the spatial units vary
* Where the values are similar we say they exhibit Spatial Autocorrelation 

Space is fixed, but **properties (values)** can vary

]

---

# Examples

* Location of blue plaques in London
* Question: Are the points clustered or are they random?

# From points to spatially continuous observations 1

* We can convert almost any point data into spatially continuous observations

### Questions
* Why should we never (or almost never) use count data (e.g. number of blue plaques per ward) for spatial autocorrelation measures?

* In what instance might we be able to use count data?

* Discuss in groups for 2 mins?

`r countdown(minutes=1, seconds =30, warn_when = 10, bottom=0, left="65%")`

---
# From points to spatially continuous observations 2

### Answers

* Summing the counts generates results that are dependent on the size of the spatial unit ...e.g...

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/grid_vs_tess_counts.svg')
```

---
# From points to spatially continuous observations 3

* In this case we could sum our counts and normalise then based on some sort of underling data - such as population. e.g...lung cancer rates or mortality rates 

Our code would look similar to this ...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
points_sf_joined <- LondonWardsMerged%>%
  st_join(BluePlaquesSub)%>%
  add_count(ward_name)%>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  #calculate area
  mutate(area=st_area(.))%>%
  #then density of the points per ward
  mutate(density=n/area)%>%
  #select density and some other variables 
  dplyr::select(density, ward_name, gss_code, n, average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014)
```

* Sometimes we can have "unstable rates" - where values are very small, consult [Coping with Unstable Rates](Gimond, 2022)
---
# From points to spatially continuous observations 4

### Answers

* An instance where it is ok to use counts is where the mapping units are spatially consistent --e.g. hexagons or Uber's H3 grid
* The variable spatial unit is removed

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/hexagons.jpg')

# Take care 2! 

If you have aggregated point data they can no longer be described as points...as [Gimond 2022 says](https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/pitfalls-to-avoid.html#ecological-fallacy)

> "you might be tempted to state that there is a strong relationship between variables v1 and v2 at the individual level. But doing so leads to the ecological fallacy where the statistical relationship at one level of aggregation is (wrongly) assumed to hold at any other levels of aggregation (including at the individual level). In fact, all you can really say is that “at this level of aggregation, we observe a strong relationship between v1 and v2” and nothing more!"

# Observed vs Expected

.pull-left[
* Comparing what we observe in the real world against what we might expect is fundamental to most spatial (and other sorts of) analyses. 

* If what we observe differs in some significant way from what we might expect, then there might be something interesting going on

* But how do we know what is expected?

  * We should expect randomness

  * Randomness conforms to known probability distributions

# Point Pattern Anaysis

### The core question..

> ### Are these points distributed in a random way or is there some sort of pattern (uniform or clustered)?

.pull-left[

* The **expected random model** is known as Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR) 

* A random distribution of points is said to have a Poisson distribution

* By comparing the distribution of observed points with a CSR Poisson model, we can tell if we have an interesting point distribution….

Compare all observations to complete spatial randomness - distribution of points that conforms to the Poisson distribution 

Comparing our observations to an idealized distribution of points - is it random or not?

# The Poisson Distribution

.pull-left[
* Describes the probability or rate of an event happening over a fixed interval of time or space

* Where the total number of events in a fixed unit is small (e.g. Breweries in a London Borough), then the probability of getting a low rate is higher

* As number of events increases, the mean (`λ` – lambda) increases and the probability distribution changes

# Hosting on GitHub

* Few ways we can do this...like CASA0005

1. `use_github()` from the `usethis` package will automatically create a repo of the same name as your RProject.

1. Or create a repository on GitHub 
  * Then use the code provided in the shell for your project that has git enabled 
  * "...or push an existing repository from the command line"
  * Let's you call the repo something other than your RProject name....
  * to do this you must **first** have commited some files to your git already. 

1. To "deploy" the presentation on GitHub pages
